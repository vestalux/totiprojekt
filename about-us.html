<p>
Our sewing business started in 2010. In the beggining we were manufacturing home decor items, bags and various other textile items that were sold in our own souvenir shop.

Throught the years we have gained a lot of experience and overcome numerous obstacles. The recent machinery upgrades and workforce expansion provides us the means to take on higher volume sewing subcontracting projects. Our priority is to meet the lead time and quality demands of our partners.

As a social enterprise our goal is to provide the necessary training and mentoring for or workforce to provide continuos improvement in our daily work and professional development for our colleagues. We provide the a safe and healthy work environment for our employees and also providing the necessary equipment for all employees. Our social enterprise employs disabled colleagues as well as empoyees who return to the the labor market after a long hiatus. To achive both our business and social goals we apply different organisational and HR solutions. We implemented flexible and variable work hours, home office and dual training.
Our performance based motivational and payment system ensures that our output keeps the contant quality and lead time and also minimizes employee turnover.
